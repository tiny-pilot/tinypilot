# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in TinyPilot! This document is meant to help developers get up to speed on TinyPilot so that they can start development with as little frustration as possible.

## Setting up a development environment

The steps below show you how to quickly set up a development environment for TinyPilot.

### Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Node.js 13.x or higher
* [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing)

### Install packages

To install TinyPilot's dev packages, run the following command:

```bash
python3.7 -m venv venv && \
  . venv/bin/activate && \
  pip install --requirement requirements.txt && \
  pip install --requirement dev_requirements.txt && \
  npm install prettier@2.0.5
```

### Run automated tests

To run TinyPilot's build scripts, run:

```bash
./dev-scripts/build
```

### Enable Git hooks

If you're planning to contribute code to TinyPilot, it's a good idea to enable the standard Git hooks so that build scripts run before you commit. That way, you can see if basic tests pass in a few seconds rather than waiting a few minutes to watch them run in CircleCI.

```bash
./hooks/enable_hooks
```

### Enable mock scripts

The TinyPilot server backend uses several privileged scripts (created in [ansible-role-tinypilot](https://github.com/mtlynch/ansible-role-tinypilot)). Those scripts exist on a provisioned TinyPilot device, but they don't exist on a dev machine.

To set up symlinks that mock out those scripts and facilitate development, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./dev-scripts/enable-mock-scripts
```

### Run in dev mode

To run TinyPilot on a non-Pi machine, run:

```bash
./dev-scripts/serve-dev
```

## Architecture

For a high-level view of TinyPilot's architecture, see the [ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md) file.

## Options

TinyPilot accepts various options through environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Default      | Description |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `HOST`               | `127.0.0.1`  | Network interface to listen for incoming connections. |
| `PORT`               | `8000`       | HTTP port to listen for incoming connections. |
| `KEYBOARD_PATH`      | `/dev/hidg0` | Path to keyboard HID interface. |
| `MOUSE_PATH`         | `/dev/hidg1` | Path to mouse HID interface. |
| `DEBUG`              | undefined    | Set to `1` to enable debug logging. |

## Code style conventions

TinyPilot follows Google code style conventions:

* [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
* [HTML/CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
* [Shell](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
* ~~[JavaScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)~~ - We are "loosely inspired" by the JS style guide, but don't observe it strictly

TinyPilot uses automated linters and formatters as much as possible to automate style conventions.

## Proposing changes

* If you're making a small change, submit a PR to show your proposal.
* If you're making a large change (over 100 LOC or three hours of dev time), [file an issue](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/issues/new/choose) first to talk through the proposed change. This prevents you from wasting time on a change that has a low chance of being accepted.

## How to get your PR merged quickly

* Read my guide, ["How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You,"](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/) to understand how to contribute effectively to an open source project.
* Give a clear, one-line title to your PR.
  * Good: `Fix dropped keystrokes on Firefox`
  * Bad: `Fix issue`
* If your PR is not ready for review, mark it as "draft."
* [Rebase your changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) onto the latest `master` commit so that there are no merge conflicts.
* Your PR must pass build checks in CI before it will be considered for merge.
  * You'll see a green checkmark or red X next to your PR depending on whether your build passed or failed.
  * You are responsible for fixing formatting and tests to ensure that your code passes build checks in CI.

I try to review all PRs within one business day. If you've been waiting longer than this, feel free to comment on the PR to verify that it's on my radar.
