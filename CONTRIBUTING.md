# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in TinyPilot! This document is meant to help developers get up to speed on TinyPilot so that they can start development with as little frustration as possible.

## Setting up a development environment

The steps below show you how to quickly set up a development environment for TinyPilot.

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js 14.17.5 or higher
- [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing)

### Install packages

To install TinyPilot's dev packages, run the following command:

```bash
python3.7 -m venv venv && \
  . venv/bin/activate && \
  pip install --requirement requirements.txt && \
  pip install --requirement dev_requirements.txt && \
  npm install
```

### Run automated tests

To run TinyPilot's build scripts, run:

```bash
./dev-scripts/build
```

### Enable Git hooks

If you're planning to contribute code to TinyPilot, it's a good idea to enable the standard Git hooks so that build scripts run before you commit. That way, you can see if basic tests pass in a few seconds rather than waiting a few minutes to watch them run in CircleCI.

```bash
./hooks/enable_hooks
```

### Enable mock scripts

The TinyPilot server backend uses several privileged scripts (created in [ansible-role-tinypilot](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/ansible-role-tinypilot)). Those scripts exist on a provisioned TinyPilot device, but they don't exist on a dev machine.

To set up symlinks that mock out those scripts and facilitate development, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./dev-scripts/enable-mock-scripts
```

### Run in dev mode

To run TinyPilot on a non-Pi machine, run:

```bash
./dev-scripts/serve-dev
```

## Setting up a device for QA/testing

For more complex changes it is useful to test your feature branch on a Raspberry Pi, in order to verify them in the real production environment.

### Setup SSH keys for login

1. [Generate SSH keys and upload your public key](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) to your device. Please use strong keys, e.g., ED25519 or RSA 4096+.
2. Verify that you can login with your SSH keys.
3. On the device, disable password-based login by specifying `PasswordAuthentication no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Reboot afterwards.

### SSH agent forwarding

In case you need SSH keys for accessing the Git repositories (e.g., for testing TinyPilot's Pro version), please enable SSH agent forwarding in your local `~/.ssh/config`.

```
Host tinypilot
  ForwardAgent yes
```

### Remote scripts

For carrying out common procedures on the device, see [here](dev-scripts/remote-scripts/README.md).

## Architecture

For a high-level view of TinyPilot's architecture, see the [ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md) file.

## Options

TinyPilot accepts various options through environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Default     | Description                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `HOST`               | `127.0.0.1` | Network interface to listen for incoming connections. |
| `PORT`               | `8000`      | HTTP port to listen for incoming connections.         |
| `DEBUG`              | undefined   | Set to `1` to enable debug logging.                   |

## Code style conventions

TinyPilot follows Google code style conventions:

- [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- [HTML/CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
- [Shell](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
- ~~[JavaScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)~~ - We are "loosely inspired" by the JS style guide, but don't observe it strictly

TinyPilot uses automated linters and formatters as much as possible to automate style conventions.

## Web Components Conventions

TinyPilot implements most of its UI components through standard JavaScript, using [web components](https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-web-components/). TinyPilot does not use any heavy frontend frameworks like Angular or React, nor does it use any broad libraries such as jQuery.

Strangely, it's uncommon for web applications to use web components directly as opposed to through a framework, so TinyPilot's developers have created their own conventions for implementing UI elements through web components.

### State changes

It's common for a component to change its appearance based on its internal state. For example, a dialog might be in an "initializing" state when it first opens and then reach a "ready" state when it's ready for user input.

In a framework like React or Vue, we'd use conditional rendering to change the UI depending on the component's internal state. With raw web components, conditional rendering is not possible. Instead, TinyPilot's convention is to add a `state` attribute to the root element with getter and setter methods that look like this:

```javascript
get state() {
  return this.getAttribute("state");
}

set state(newValue) {
  this.setAttribute("state", newValue);
}
```

We enumerate all possible state values in the states property on the web component class, like so:

```javascript
class extends HTMLElement {
    states = {
        INITIALIZING: "initializing",
        FETCH_FROM_URL: "fetch-from-url",
        VIEW: "view",
    };
```

The class attribute `states` can then be used in the JavaScript component code:

```javascript
this.state = this.states.FETCH_FROM_URL;
```

We then use CSS rules based on the `state` attribute to control the component's appearance:

```html
<style>
  #initializing,
  #fetch-from-url {
    display: none;
  }

  :host([state="initializing"]) #initializing {
    display: block;
  }

  :host([state="fetch-from-url"]) #fetch-from-url {
    display: block;
  }
</style>

<div id="initializing">
  <h3>Retrieving Information</h3>
  <progress-spinner></progress-spinner>
</div>

<div id="fetch-from-url">
  <h3>Manage Virtual Media: Fetch from URL</h3>
  ...
</div>
```

This ensures that the elements in the `<div id="initializing">` only appear when the component's state is `initializing`.

Prefer to change a web component's appearance based on attributes and CSS rules as opposed to JavaScript that manipulates the `.style` attributes of elements within the component.

### Disable closing a dialog

For a component that is used within an overlay, there might be certain states that should prevent the user from closing the dialog. Thatâ€™s typically the case when we are waiting for an action to complete (for example when loading something).

These particular states are listed in the `statesWithoutDialogClose` class property, like so:

```javascript
class extends HTMLElement {
    states = {
        INITIALIZING: "initializing",
        FETCH_FROM_URL: "fetch-from-url",
        VIEW: "view",
    };
    statesWithoutDialogClose = new Set([this.states.INITIALIZING]);
```

Note: for consistency, we always use a `Set` here, even if it only contains a single element.

In the state setter, we emit an event to inform the enclosing overlay whether or not to show the `x` close button.

```javascript
set state(newValue) {
    this.setAttribute("state", newValue);
    this.dispatchEvent(
    new DialogCloseStateChangedEvent(
        !this.statesWithoutDialogClose.has(newValue)
    )
    );
}
```

This event will be picked up by the `overlay-panel` which will hide the X close button.

### Create element references in `connectedCallback()`

If a component's JavaScript requires access to any of the elements in the web component's HTML, assign those elements an `id` attribute and store them in a member object called `this.elements`

```javascript
connectedCallback() {
  this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
  this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
  this.elements = {
    noFilesText: this.shadowRoot.getElementById("no-backing-files"),
    table: this.shadowRoot.getElementById("backing-files-table"),
    tableBody: this.shadowRoot.getElementById("table-body"),
    uploadFromUrlInput: this.shadowRoot.getElementById(
      "fetch-from-url-input"
    ),
    uploadFromUrlInputError: this.shadowRoot.getElementById(
      "fetch-from-url-input-error"
    ),
  };
};
```

### Use underscore to represent private methods

Most of the functions in a web component are only intended for usage within the component. For these functions, prepend the function name with an underscore like `_upload() { ... }`. Functions that accept input from external callers should be prefix-free like `show()`.

### Use free functions where possible

If a function does not reference any of the web component's member variables through `this`, convert it to a free function outside of the `HTMLElement` subclass.

If a function only requires access to one or two member variables, consider making it a free function anyway and accessing those values through function parameters.

Free functions are easier to reason about than member functions, as free functions have access to fewer variables and functions that can change an object's state.

### Parameterizing style rules

Web components have a separate ["shadow DOM,"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) which means that they don't inherit most CSS rules from their parent elements. In some cases, it's useful for a web component to accept style customization through the parent element's HTML.

TinyPilot's convention for this is to define CSS variables in the `:host` section like so:

```css
:host {
  --offset-top: 1rem;
}

h2 {
  margin-top: var(--offset-top);
}
```

Using CSS variables means that we can parameterize these values via the `style` attribute when we include instances of the component in HTML:

```html
<my-component style="--offset-top: 3rem"></my-component>
```

### Referencing DOM elements

In short, if your component has multiple [states](#state-changes) then prefer to reference an element using the `class` attribute to avoid naming conflicts. Otherwise, reference an element using the `id` attribute as needed.

More verbosely, in order to reference a DOM element using JavaScript, we need to first name the element using the `id` or `class` attribute.

For example, say we have a component that creates a user:

```html
<div class="btn-container">
  <button id="confirm-btn">Confirm Create<button>
</div>
```

```javascript
const confirmButton = document.querySelector("#confirm-btn");
const buttonContainer = document.querySelector(".btn-container");
```

The above example is a rather straightforward way of naming and selecting DOM elements. However, things can get complicated when the component has multiple [states](#state-changes).

For example, say that we expand our component to also delete a user:

```html
<div id="create">
  <div class="btn-container">
    <button id="confirm-create-btn">Confirm Create<button>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="delete">
  <div class="btn-container">
    <button id="confirm-delete-btn">Confirm Delete<button>
  </div>
</div>
```

```javascript
const confirmCreateButton = document.querySelector("#confirm-create-btn");
const confirmDeleteButton = document.querySelector("#confirm-delete-btn");

const confirmCreateButtonContainer = document.querySelector(
  "#create .btn-container"
);
const confirmDeleteButtonContainer = document.querySelector(
  "#delete .btn-container"
);
```

Notice how we needed to rename both our button IDs to distinguish between the create and delete buttons.

Also notice how we did not need to rename our button container classes because their query selector can be scoped to a specific component state.

In order to avoid namespacing individual element IDs, as we expand a component, we prefer to name an element using the `class` attribute and namespace the query selector instead.

So instead of this:

```javascript
document.querySelector("#confirm-create-btn");
document.querySelector("#confirm-delete-btn");
```

we do this:

```javascript
document.querySelector("#create .confirm-btn");
document.querySelector("#delete .confirm-btn");
```

Let's complete our example by pulling it altogether:

```html
<div id="create">
  <div class="btn-container">
    <button class="confirm-btn">Confirm Create<button>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="delete">
  <div class="btn-container">
    <button class="confirm-btn">Confirm Delete<button>
  </div>
</div>
```

```javascript
const confirmCreateButton = document.querySelector("#create .confirm-btn");
const confirmDeleteButton = document.querySelector("#delete .confirm-btn");
```
