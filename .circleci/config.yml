# This file uses CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature, which can dynamically
# generate pipeline parameters and/or YAML configurations. See
# https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/
# In this case, we're dynamically loading the rest of our YAML configurations
# (i.e., .circleci/continue_config.yml) at runtime.
