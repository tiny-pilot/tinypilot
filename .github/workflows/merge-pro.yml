            ${{ github.actor }}, please merge the last changes from community repository:

            https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/commit/${{ github.sha }}

            **Do not use "Squash and merge"!**

            Merge this PR with a merge commit, keeping the commit history.

            (If you accidentally squash, it's not a disaster, but it will create a bit of noise on the subsequent PR from Community)
