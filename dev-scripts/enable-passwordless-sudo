# In production, TinyPilot has permission to run an allowlist of paths with sudo
# permissions. For developers who don't have passwordless sudo enabled globally
# for their user account, certain TinyPilot functionality will fail waiting on a
# sudo escalation prompt. This script prevents those failures by granting your
# dev user account passwordless sudo for the specific paths the TinyPilot dev
# server needs.
