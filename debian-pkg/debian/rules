# This is a workaround for a behavior I don't understand in dh_install. It would
# be simpler to simply build the package's filesystem within the
# debian/tinypilot path to begin with, but when I try that, debhelper tools
# can't see the tinypilot folder. As a workaround, we build the filesystem in a
# folder called "fileroot" and then rename the folder to debian/tinypilot just
# before dh_install.
