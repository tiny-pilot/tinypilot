## Overview

Turn your Raspberry Pi into a browser-based KVM.

![TinyPilot demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/master/demo.gif)

## Pre-requisites

* Raspberry Pi OS Stretch or later
* python3-venv

## Hardware requirements

All-in-one kits are available from [tinypilotkvm.com](https://tinypilotkvm.com/order).

* [Raspberry Pi 4](https://amzn.to/3fdarLM) (all variants work)
* [HDMI to USB dongle](https://amzn.to/2YHEvJN)
  * It has no brand name, but you can identify them by sight.
  * They're available for $10-15 on eBay.
* [USB-C to USB-A](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Type-C-USB-Male-Cable/dp/B01GGKYN0A/) cable (Male/Male)
* [microSD card](https://amzn.to/2VH0RcL) (Class 10, 8 GB or larger)
* [HDMI to HDMI cable](https://amzn.to/3gnlZwj)
  * Or \[other\] to HDMI, depending on how your target machine displays output.
* (Optional) [A USB-C OTG split connector](https://tinypilotkvm.com/product/tinypilot-power-connector): Supports continuous power when the target computer turns off.
  * Requires two additional [USB-A to microUSB cables](https://amzn.to/2Z5eJiF).
  * If you're using this split connector, choose a USB-C to USB-A cable that's [12" or shorter](https://amzn.to/3hayLOJ) to minimize voltage drop along the cable.
* (Optional) [VGA to HDMI Adapter](https://amzn.to/30SZWYh)
  * If your target computer has VGA output, the above adapter is [confirmed to work](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/issues/76#issuecomment-664736402) with TinyPilot.

See ["TinyPilot: Build a KVM Over IP for Under $100"](https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/#how-to-build-your-own-tinypilot) for a more detailed tutorial on how to assemble these parts to create a TinyPilot.

## Simple installation

You can install TinyPilot on a compatible Raspberry Pi in just two commands.

```bash
curl \
  --silent \
  --show-error \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/master/quick-install | \
    bash - && \
  sudo reboot
```

The installation process:

* Creates a service account for TinyPilot with limited priviliges.
* Installs TinyPilot as a systemd service so it runs automatically on every boot.
* Installs TinyPilot's dependencies.

When your Pi reboots, you should be able to access TinyPilot by visiting your Pi hostname in the browser. For example, if your device is named `raspberrypi`:

* [http://raspberrypi/](http://raspberrypi/)

### Other installation options

* [Advanced installation options](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/wiki/Installation-Options#advanced-installation)
* [Remote installation via Ansible](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/wiki/Installation-Options#remote-installation)
* [Developer installation](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/wiki/Installation-Options#developer-installation)

## Options

TinyPilot accepts various options through environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Default      | Description |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `HOST`               | `0.0.0.0`    | Network interface to listen for incoming connections. |
| `PORT`               | `8000`       | HTTP port to listen for incoming connections. |
| `KEYBOARD_PATH`      | `/dev/hidg0` | Path to keyboard HID interface. |
| `MOUSE_PATH`         | `/dev/hidg1` | Path to mouse HID interface. |

## Upgrades

The installation script is idempotent, so you can upgrade to the latest stable release of TinyPilot and its dependencies by just re-running [the quick install script](#simple-installation).

## Security considerations

TinyPilot does not support authentication. You should only use TinyPilot on networks that you trust. Anyone who accesses the TinyPilot URL can shutdown or restart your Pi and type arbitrary commands into the device to which your Pi is connected.

If you need authentication, the simplest solution would be to adjust your Nginx configuration (included by default with the installation) to require [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-http-basic-authentication/).
