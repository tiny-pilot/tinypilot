# To create a new EDID:
#  1. Convert the existing EDID to binary using "edid2bin".
#  2. Edit the binary using "AW EDID Editor v.02.00.13".
#  3. Save the new EDID in binary format.
#  4. Convert the binary EDID to a hex EDID using "make-edid".
#    - Use the "--yaml" option if required.

# Note: You may need to perform a few extra steps in order for the EDID
# to conform to edid-decode's check - but only if the "Display Range Limits"
# block changes. This is due to a bug in AW EDID Editor v.02.00.13 that doesn't
# set the correct bytes.
# To work around this:
#  1. Open the new EDID in "AW EDID Editor v.3.0.10".
#  2. Save the EDID to set correct bytes in the "Display Range Limits" block
#  3. Re-open the EDID in "AW EDID Editor v.02.00.13" and re-set
#     the screen size dimensions to 0 (both vertical and horizontal)

# EDID for TC358743 chip.
