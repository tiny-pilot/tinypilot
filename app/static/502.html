    <h1>TinyPilot is Not Running</h1>
    <p>
      You have connected successfully to your TinyPilot device, but the
      TinyPilot web application doesn't seem to be running.
    </p>
    <p>
      This error can occur if you tried to access the TinyPilot page too quickly
      after starting your TinyPilot device.
    </p>

    <p>Please reload the page.</p>

    <button
      type="button"

    </button>

    <p>
      If you continue to see this message, please try the following
      troubleshooting steps:
    </p>

    <h2>Solution 1: Restart the TinyPilot service</h2>
    <p>
      If you previously enabled
      <a href="https://tinypilotkvm.com/faq/ssh-credentials">SSH</a> on your
      TinyPilot, you can check whether the TinyPilot service is running by
      logging in via SSH and running the following command:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sudo service tinypilot status</code></pre>

    <p>
      If the service is not listed as <code>Active: active (running)</code>,
      restart the TinyPilot service with the following command:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sudo service tinypilot restart</code></pre>

    <p>After the command completes, reload this page.</p>

    <h2>Solution 2: Restart your TinyPilot</h2>
    <p>
      If you previously enabled SSH on your TinyPilot, log in via SSH and try
      restarting your TinyPilot by running the following command:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you don't have SSH access, wait two minutes before powering off your
      TinyPilot. Then, power on your TinyPilot, and wait a minute before
      reloading this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution 3: Reset your TinyPilot to factory settings</h2>
    <p>
      If you have just updated your TinyPilot, or if your TinyPilot recently
      experienced sudden power loss, your TinyPilot may have a corrupted
      filesystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://tinypilotkvm.com/faq/factory-reset">factory reset</a>
      will restore your TinyPilot back to a working state.
    </p>
