"""
For evolving our database schema over time, we follow the idea of “evolutionary
database design” (https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html), which is
also used by DB migration tools like Liquibase or the one in Django.

The requirements for our app are rather simple, so instead of pulling in a
heavy-weight tool, we maintain our own mechanism. It is based off the exact same
philosophy, which is basically this:

- The database schema is defined through the linear sequence of migration
  statements. These are applied from the first to the last. After the last
  migration has run, the final schema is in place. We use the `_MIGRATIONS`
  list for storing all our migrations statements.
- The incremental nature of this migration approach guarantees us that the
  entirety of all individual steps will always produce the exact same result,
  regardless of what initial version we start from. The downside is that we
  don’t see the final schema in the code directly.
- For keeping track of what migrations we have already run, we use SQlite’s
  `user_version` (https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_user_version)
  PRAGMA property. The value is effectively the count of migrations that have
  already been run, so a value of `3` means that the first 3 migrations from the
  `_MIGRATIONS` list have already been applied.
- Existing migration statements must be considered immutable, so you should only
  ever add new ones, but never modify existing statements. If you e.g. need to
  rollback something, you have to add a new migration that carries out the
  “inverse operation”. Contrary to other migration tools, we don’t write
  rollback procedures for every step, because our migrations are run
  automatically after the device had been updated. A rollback would require
  manual intervention, however. Therefore, it’s especially important to review
  and test every migration thoroughly.

Historical note: we didn’t have migrations right from the start, but we added
this functionality in January 2022. So for “old”/legacy databases it might occur
that the table structure of the first four migrations is already in place, but
the `user_version` property still has the initial value `0`. Nevertheless, it’s
always safe to run the first four migrations, because they are written in an
idempotent way. Once the migration mechanism was applied for the first time,
the database file is successfully converted to the “new” format, and from then
on it works the same everywhere.
