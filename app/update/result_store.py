"""Manages persistent data about the result of the most recent TinyPilot update.

The update result store stores and fetches the result of the last update.
Because the TinyPilot server holds no state in memory, it relies on files stored
in the ~/logs directory to record the result of the most recent update.

The flow of an update is as follows:

1. User initiates an update.
2. Server clears result files of all previous updates.
3. Server initiates the update process.
4. User queries for update status and the server reports an update is in
    progress because it can see the update process running.
5. User repeats (4) for a few minutes until the update completes.
6. At the end of the update, the update process writes an update result file.
7. The next time the user queries for update status, the server reads the
   update result file and reports the result of the update based on the file's
   contents.
